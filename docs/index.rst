ADCIRC Model Documentation
==========================

Welcome to the ADCIRC (ADvanced CIRCulation) model documentation. The ADCIRC model is a system of computer programs for solving time dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two and three dimensions. These programs utilize the finite element method in space allowing the use of highly flexible, unstructured grids.

This documentation is actively being consolidated and enhanced, incorporating content from the `ADCIRC website <https://adcirc.org>`_ and `ADCIRC Wiki <https://wiki.adcirc.org/Main_Page>`_ into a single, comprehensive resource. Refer to these sources for additional information.

There is an ADCIRC listserv for users to ask questions and share information. If you would like to join the ADCIRC listserv, please email Crystal Fulcher at cfulcher@email.unc.edu.
